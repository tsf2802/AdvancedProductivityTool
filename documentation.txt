All Installation Requirements for Project:
PostgreSQL 14.53 for Python 3.9, Create New Database in pgAdmin called 'genshin', set db password to 'dbpass'
pip install pyqt5 22.2.1
pip install psycopg2 

Notes:
MySQL only works for older versions of vs code (2019) so I decided to learn PostgresSQL but within python its behavior is essentially the same.
